.PP

A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional variable assignments

followed by \fBblank\fP-separated words and redirections, and

terminated by a \fIcontrol operator\fP. The first word

specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero.

The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.

.PP

.SH "COMMAND EXECUTION"

After a command has been split into words, if it results in a

simple command and an optional list of arguments, the shell attempts to

locate it. Simple Shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that

builtin is invoked.

.PP

If the name is a builtin,

.B Simple shell

searches each element of the

.SM

.B PATH

for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
